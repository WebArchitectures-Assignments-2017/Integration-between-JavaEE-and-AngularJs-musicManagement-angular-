# Introduction:

This assignment is about html5, javascript and in particular AngularJs, an open-source web
framework used to develop single-page web applications.
Its goal was to develop a simple application which shows an integration between Java EE (used as
REST web service) and AngularJS used in order to develop the user interface (front-end) part.
The project follows the line of the http://www.radcortez.com/java-ee-7-with-angular-js-crud-rest-
validations-part-2 application and the functionalities are basically the same.
The application, in broad terms, is structured in order to manage a simple music project
management software that allow user to perform all the basic CRUD operations on two entities:
“MusicalGenre” and “Song” related together through a One to Many relationship.
